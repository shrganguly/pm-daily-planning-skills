# Teams Quick Capture Template

## 30-Second Teams Scan Method

### Step 1: Open Teams (5 sec)
- Click Activity (🔔) icon

### Step 2: Scan @Mentions (10 sec)
Look for red badges with @
- Note: Channel + Person + Topic
- Example: "product-team, John, PRD review"

### Step 3: Check Chats (10 sec)
Look for unread DMs (bold)
- Note: Person + Topic
- Example: "Sarah, roadmap sync"

### Step 4: Check Channels (5 sec)
Look for red badges on channels
- Note: Channel + Topic
- Example: "engineering, sprint blocker"

### Step 5: Type into /plan-my-day
Use SHORT keywords:
```
@product John PRD, DM Sarah roadmap, #eng blocker
```

**Total: 30 seconds**

---

## Keyword Shorthand

**Instead of:**
"@Shreya in #product-team from John asking about PRD review deadline"

**Type:**
"@product John PRD deadline"

**I'll expand it in the daily plan to:**
- [ ] **#product-team** - @Shreya PRD review deadline (John)

---

## Common Patterns

**@Mentions:**
- Format: `@channel person topic`
- Example: `@product John PRD`, `@design Sarah mockups`

**Direct Messages:**
- Format: `DM person topic`
- Example: `DM Sarah roadmap`, `DM Mike question`

**Channel Messages:**
- Format: `#channel topic`
- Example: `#eng blocker`, `#product feature-request`

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Use abbreviations:**
   - "prod" = product-team
   - "eng" = engineering
   - "des" = design

2. **Skip if no action needed:**
   - Only capture messages that need YOUR response
   - FYI messages → skip

3. **Batch similar items:**
   - "3 DMs about roadmap" instead of listing each

4. **Use urgency markers:**
   - "!" = urgent
   - Example: `@product John PRD!` = needs response today
